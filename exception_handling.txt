if we write 
var number="1234";
byte b=Convert.ToByte(number);
Console.WriteLine(b);
it will give an exception error as byte does not hav eenough storage to store this value so in this case it will crash the program and show some exception
To handle this exception we will use try-catch block where in the try block we will type our code and the catch block will catch the exception. Like this-
try
{
    var number="1234";
    byte b=Convert.ToByte(number);
    Console.WriteLine(b);
}
catch(exception)
{
    Console.WriteLine("The number could not be converted in byte");//that's how it will save the program from crashing
}

//also notable thing is that if the code in the try block is executable then it executes.
